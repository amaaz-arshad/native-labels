QUESTION
=========
I'm trying to scale an Aztec barcode to a 5"x5.5" label, but the default Aztec encoder doesn't create any barcodes larger than about 0.25"x0.25".

How can I scale it larger?

My code is below:

^XA
^MTD
^BON,10,N,250,N,1,0
^FO100,100 ^FD Barcode Text^FS
^FO275,1350^AVN,200,200^FDText of Barcode Text^FS
^XZ

ANSWER
========
The Aztec barcode command:

^B0a,b,c,d,e,f,g
Where b is the magnification. And would change the symbol's "dot" size.

Where d is the error control and symbol size/type indicator and would change the redundancy.

You had your d set to something out of the range (250), which caused it to default to 0. More redundancy means larger symbol, but not the symbol's "dot" size.

Accepted Values for d:

0 = default error correction level
01 to 99 = error correction percentage (minimum)
101 to 104 = 1 to 4-layer compact symbol
201 to 232 = 1 to 32-layer full-range symbol
300 = a simple Aztec “Rune”
Default Value: 0
Example ZPL to make a "bigger" symbol:

^XA
^MTD
^BON,10,N,208,N,1,0
^FO100,100 ^FD Barcode Text^FS
^FO100,700^AVN,100,100^FDText of Barcode Text^FS
^XZ
